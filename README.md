## Problem Statement

Azerbaijan sits at the intersection of three distinct climate zones — semi-arid lowlands, a humid subtropical Caspian coast, and alpine Caucasus highlands — making it both ecologically significant and disproportionately fire-prone. Temperatures have risen **+0.4 °C/decade** since 1980 while summer precipitation declines, dramatically increasing wildfire risk across the Greater and Lesser Caucasus (≈1.2 M ha of commercial forest). The Baku–Absheron peninsula and the Kura-Araz lowlands experience extreme summer drought annually, while highland forests face prolonged dry spells with no natural firebreak management. Despite these conditions, **no regional 30-day fire-risk forecast exists for Azerbaijan**.

ARIAN addresses this gap by integrating satellite imagery, multi-source meteorological archives, and the Azerbaijani State Forest Management Inventory (MESE QURULUSU) into a unified ML pipeline that delivers daily wildfire probability scores, expected fire counts, and multi-target 30-day weather forecasts across 16 Azerbaijani cities.

## Why It Matters

Wildfire incidents have increased measurably since 2010. The 2021–2022 fire seasons alone caused substantial forest loss across the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, with the national forest estate (≈1.2 M hectares) at sustained risk. Early-warning forecasts give emergency services **7–14 days of operational lead time** to pre-position firefighting resources and issue timely civilian evacuation orders, directly reducing the estimated **~$70–80 M/year** in economic losses from extreme weather events in Azerbaijan.

| Problem | ARIAN Solution |
|---------|----------------|
| No regional-scale 30-day weather forecast | ML ensemble trained on 6+ years of hourly Open-Meteo archive data |
| Wildfire risk assessments are reactive, not predictive | Calibrated 30-day forward fire probability using fire-science features (FWI, drought) |
| No early-warning system for high-risk fire windows | Canadian FWI system + SPEI drought indices provide 7–14 day structural lead time |
| Climate trend reports require GIS expertise | Automated Mann-Kendall + Theil-Sen trend analysis per city, output to CSV |
| Operational data scattered across agencies | Single REST API (FastAPI) aggregates weather, wildfire risk, and climate insights |
| No structured forest inventory for fire risk zoning | MESE QURULUSU provides stand-level species, crown density, and age class per polygon |

## Target

| Variable | Type | Definition |
|----------|------|------------|
| **`fire_occurred`** | Binary (0/1) | 1 if ≥1 NASA FIRMS VIIRS-SNPP hotspot falls within 50 km of city centroid on forecast date. Label window: next-day 00:00–23:59 local time. |
| **`fire_count`** | Non-negative integer | Expected number of FIRMS hotspots in the same 50 km buffer; modelled with Poisson regression to enforce non-negative predictions. |

**Label construction:** VIIRS-SNPP hotspots (~375 m resolution) are spatially joined to per-city 50 km circular buffers. Each (city, date) pair receives a binary fire label and a raw hotspot count. Both targets are computed before any feature engineering to prevent leakage.

## Horizon

**t+1 to t+30 days** — daily wildfire risk scores and multi-target weather forecasts.

Direct multi-horizon models are trained independently at checkpoints **h = {1, 3, 7, 14, 30}**, eliminating the recursive error accumulation inherent in autoregressive approaches (a 0.5 °C/step error compounds to ≈15 °C drift at h=30). Intermediate horizons (2, 4–6, 8–13, 15–29 days) are piecewise-linearly interpolated between checkpoint forecasts, preserving temporal monotonicity without architectural complexity.

## Key Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **FWI** | Canadian Fire Weather Index — six-component fire danger rating system (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI, DSR) computed from temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. Industry standard validated across decades of fire data (Van Wagner, 1987). |
| **FFMC** | Fine Fuel Moisture Code — moisture content of surface litter and fine fuels (0–101 scale). FFMC ≥ 82 = high; ≥ 87 = extreme fire danger. |
| **DC** | Drought Code — moisture content of deep organic layers. DC > 300 indicates extreme drought; used as a hard threshold feature in the wildfire model. |
| **DSR** | Daily Severity Rating — exponential FWI transformation measuring expected fire suppression difficulty. DSR > 20 = extreme operational demand. |
| **SPEI** | Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index — drought measure incorporating evaporative demand. SPEI ≤ −1.0: moderate drought · ≤ −1.5: severe · ≤ −2.0: extreme. `spei_3` (3-month) is the primary seasonal signal; `spei_1` captures short-term fuel dryness entering fire season. |
| **FIRMS** | NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System — real-time and historical satellite fire hotspot detections from VIIRS-SNPP (~375 m) and MODIS (~1 km) sensors. |
| **MESE QURULUSU** | Azerbaijani State Forest Management Inventory — stand-level polygons with species composition, crown density (0.1–1.0 in 0.1 increments), age class (20-year brackets), and RMTM administrative unit. Unique competitive advantage over open-access land-cover products. |
| **HGBC / HGBR** | HistGradientBoostingClassifier / Regressor (scikit-learn) — primary wildfire models. Classifier uses isotonic calibration (5-fold CV) for reliable probability output; regressor uses Poisson loss to enforce non-negative fire count predictions. |
| **AUC-ROC** | Area Under the ROC Curve — primary classifier evaluation metric. Target ≥ 0.85. Supplemented by Average Precision (target ≥ 0.55) given class imbalance. |
| **NDWI** | Normalized Difference Water Index — (NIR − SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR). Values < −0.1 indicate vegetation water stress; < −0.3 is critical fire-risk territory. |
| **Mann-Kendall** | Non-parametric monotonic trend test applied to annual temperature and precipitation series per city. Paired with Theil-Sen slope estimation for magnitude. |
